#Redis
#Gitlab CE uses Redis to store user sessions and a task queue. In production, you would want it to be a bit more resilient than we show here, but for the most part, the data stored in Redis is not critical, so weâ€™re opting to not persist any data for it for this demo. So its entry in our docker-compose manifest is fairly simple: 
redis:
  restart: always
  image: redis:3.0.7-alpine
